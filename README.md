Boids Project
A tutorial that shows how Object-Oriented programming works by creating flock-like behavior in 'boids' by creating scripts that apply behaviors to all instances of an object type without having to code the behavior for each individual instance. Revolves around a 'spawner' that creates instances of boids that react to one another.
